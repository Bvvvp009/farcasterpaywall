This is a sample text file for testing Lit Protocol file encryption.

File Information:
- Created: 2024
- Purpose: Testing file encryption and decryption
- Content: Confidential information that should be encrypted

This file demonstrates how Lit Protocol can encrypt any text-based file
and only allow decryption for users who have paid access through the smart contract.

Features being tested:
✅ Text file encryption
✅ Smart contract access control
✅ File content preservation
✅ Decryption verification

The file should be encrypted and stored on IPFS, then only decrypted
for users who have valid access through the smart contract.
