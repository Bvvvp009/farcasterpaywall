# Encryption System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Subscription Decryption Issue

**Problem**: The subscription decryption was using the creator's address instead of the subscriber's address, causing decryption to fail.

**Root Cause**: In `src/components/ContentView.tsx`, the `decryptKeyForSubscriptionAccess` function was being called with `metadata.creator` (creator address) instead of `address` (subscriber address).

**Fix**: 
- Updated `ContentView.tsx` to pass the subscriber's address (`address!`) instead of the creator's address
- Updated `encryption-secure.ts` to properly handle subscriber verification in `decryptKeyForSubscriptionAccess`

### 2. Individual Post Payment Isolation Issue

**Problem**: When a user paid for one post of a creator, they were getting access to other posts by the same creator.

**Root Cause**: The system was not properly isolating encryption keys per content. Each post should have its own unique encryption key.

**Fix**: 
- Verified that `CreateContent.tsx` already generates unique encryption keys for each piece of content
- Added proper verification in `decryptKeyForPaidAccess` to check individual payment status
- Each content ID gets its own unique encryption key and payment verification

### 3. Key Sharing Between Posts Issue

**Problem**: The encryption system was not properly verifying that users had paid for specific content.

**Root Cause**: The decryption functions were not properly verifying payment status for individual content.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced `decryptKeyForPaidAccess` to verify payment status via API call
- Enhanced `decryptKeyForSubscriptionAccess` to verify subscription status via API call
- Added proper error handling for payment/subscription verification

## Technical Details

### Fixed Functions

#### 1. `decryptKeyForSubscriptionAccess` (in `src/lib/encryption-secure.ts`)

**Before**:
```typescript
export async function decryptKeyForSubscriptionAccess(
  encryptedKeyMetadata: EncryptedKeyMetadata,
  creatorAddress: string, // ❌ Wrong parameter
  contentId: string
): Promise<string>
```

**After**:
```typescript
export async function decryptKeyForSubscriptionAccess(
  encryptedKeyMetadata: EncryptedKeyMetadata,
  subscriberAddress: string, // ✅ Correct parameter
  contentId: string
): Promise<string> {
  // Extract creator address from the subscription proof
  const creatorAddress = encryptedKeyMetadata.userAddress
  
  // CRITICAL: Verify that the subscriber has an active subscription to this creator
  const subscriptionResponse = await fetch('/api/subscriptions/check', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      creatorAddress,
      subscriberAddress,
    }),
  })
  
  const subscriptionData = await subscriptionResponse.json()
  if (!subscriptionData.hasActiveSubscription) {
    throw new Error('Active subscription required to decrypt this content')
  }
  
  // ... rest of decryption logic
}
```

#### 2. `ContentView.tsx` - Subscription Decryption Call

**Before**:
```typescript
decryptedKey = await decryptKeyForSubscriptionAccess(
  metadata.encryptionKey, 
  metadata.creator, // ❌ Wrong: using creator address
  cid
)
```

**After**:
```typescript
decryptedKey = await decryptKeyForSubscriptionAccess(
  metadata.encryptionKey, 
  address!, // ✅ Correct: using subscriber address
  cid
)
```

### Key Isolation Verification

Each piece of content now has:

1. **Unique Encryption Key**: Generated using `generateEncryptionKey()` for each content
2. **Content-Specific Key Encryption**: Keys are encrypted using content ID in the master key derivation
3. **Individual Payment Verification**: Each content requires its own payment verification
4. **Subscription Verification**: Subscription access is verified per creator-subscriber pair

### Testing

Added comprehensive tests in `SubscriptionTest.tsx`:

1. **Subscription Test**: Tests subscription-based encryption/decryption
2. **End-to-End Test**: Tests complete subscription workflow
3. **Individual Post Isolation Test**: Tests that paying for one post doesn't give access to others

## Security Improvements

### 1. Proper Access Control
- Individual payments are verified per content ID
- Subscription access is verified per creator-subscriber pair
- Cryptographic signatures prevent tampering

### 2. Key Isolation
- Each content has a unique encryption key
- Keys are bound to specific content IDs
- No key sharing between different content

### 3. Payment Verification
- Server-side verification of payment status
- Server-side verification of subscription status
- Proper error handling for verification failures

## Usage Examples

### Individual Payment Access
```typescript
// Each content requires its own payment
const decryptedKey1 = await decryptKeyForPaidAccess(
  encryptedKey1, 
  userAddress,
  contentId1, // Specific content ID
  tipAmount1
)

const decryptedKey2 = await decryptKeyForPaidAccess(
  encryptedKey2, 
  userAddress,
  contentId2, // Different content ID - requires separate payment
  tipAmount2
)
```

### Subscription Access
```typescript
// Subscription gives access to all content by a creator
const decryptedKey = await decryptKeyForSubscriptionAccess(
  encryptedKeyMetadata,
  subscriberAddress, // Subscriber's address
  contentId
)
```

## Verification

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Test Subscription Access**: 
   - Create a subscription
   - Try to decrypt subscription content
   - Should work with subscriber address

2. **Test Individual Post Isolation**:
   - Pay for one post
   - Try to access another post by same creator
   - Should fail (requires separate payment)

3. **Test Key Isolation**:
   - Verify that different content has different encryption keys
   - Verify that paying for one content doesn't give access to others

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/encryption-secure.ts` - Fixed subscription decryption logic
2. `src/components/ContentView.tsx` - Fixed subscription decryption call
3. `src/components/SubscriptionTest.tsx` - Added comprehensive tests

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes with real content creation and access
2. Verify that subscription payments work correctly
3. Test edge cases (expired subscriptions, cancelled payments, etc.)
4. Monitor for any remaining issues in production
